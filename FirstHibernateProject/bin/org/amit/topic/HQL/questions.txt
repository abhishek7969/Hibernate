What is a HQL?
what is sql injection and how can be prevented?
what is a named query? (Allows us us to write queries at the entity level, and can be referred any where in application)


















In SQL query we think of tables, but in HQL we think of object.Fetch all the details of this object.
column name is the property name in the hql.
instead of returning the record set , it return the list of object .
